## Random Palette Generator
This website allows you to generate and save a random color palette and adjust them to your liking.

##### Deploy link
[Try the website here!](https://artanmyrtolli.github.io/color-random/)

#### Description
Use our site to generate a five color palette swab! The user can generate a new palette set, lock specific colors and then randomize unlocked colors. This new palette can be saved to be referenced later and can also be deleted.  

### Getting Started
To clone to your local machine please follow these steps:
1. Copy the SSH
2. In the terminal run the following commands:
```
git clone git@github.com:michaelputnam67/color-random.git
cd color-random
open index.html
```
3. Start creating new palettes!

#### Dependencies
The project is ready to go when you are. Open it in your browser with the link above and get ready to make some new custom color palettes.

#### Execution
##### Generating New Palettes
- On load you will see five random generated colors.
- If you wish to view an entirely new palette press the **"New Palette" button**.
- If you are satisfied with a specific color click anywhere on the color, its corresponding hexcode or the lock icon.
- When the color is locked the lock icon will toggle from an unlocked icon to a locked icon. 
- If you click the **"New Palette" button** now only the unlocked colors will changed while the locked colors will remain the same.

##### Saving the Current Palette
- If you really like your currently displayed palette press the **"Save Palette" button**.
- Saved palettes will be displayed on the right hand side in the same order they were saved.
- After the **"Save Palette" button** is pressed the button will be disabled until the **"New Palette" button** is pressed.
- The user is still free to lock or unlock colors as they wish.

#### Deleting Saved Palettes
- When a palette is saved and displayed in the **"Saved Palettes"** section a trash icon will be display to the right of the palette.
- When a users cursor is hovering over the trash can it will toggle to a different trash can indicating it can be clicked.

### Future Additions
In the future, we hope to do the following:
- Add a feature where the user has to confirm that they wish to delete palettes form the **"Saved Palettes"** after they click the trashcan icon located next to it.
- Add a feature that will allow users the ability to select previously saved palettes to then add it back to the main screen to then edit it again.
- Add a feature that will allow a user to double-click a color in the saved palettes. After double clicking the user will then have this color-hex added to their clipboard to paste in their code where necessary.
- Add a feature that will allow the user to manually enter a hex-code value to the main palette. After entering the hex-code and clicking on the lock icon or hitting the enter/return key the specified color will be displayed and locked to randomly generate colors in the other color blocks.

### Areas For Growth
- There is plenty of room for refactoring our JavaScript. Many of our functions like the ```addMiniPalettesHTML()``` could be much dryer if we utilized methods like ```.CreateElement and Element.appendChild()``` and then added the hexcodes by iterating over our saved palettes colors array to the newly generated class. 
- The global array with 5 nulls allows us to preserve colors from a previous instantiation of palette and pass them in as values to allow the user to keep those colors instead of generating a whole new set of colors. This array along with the ```new Color``` instantiation could possibly have been better implemented as a method within the ```Palette Class```. 
- Professionaly at the beginning of the project we were not allowing enough space for everyone to express their views and began to fragment when progress ground to a hault. To our credit we took the time to adress this issues, worked through it, and went on to successfuly complete the project. However, we could have avoided this if we spent more time seriously defining the relationship at the beginning. 
- Our git process was solid for the most part but our branch names were not always consistent.
